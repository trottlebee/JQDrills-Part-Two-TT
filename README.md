Tasks for Part Two


Great job! Now, delete the code for creating the h2 and we are going to work on creating a list
Use jQuery to create an unordered list and append it to the body
When the user submits the form, append the text as list item to the unordered list
When the user clicks on the li element, assign it a random color.
When the user double clicks on the list, remove the item that was clicked on. (hint)
